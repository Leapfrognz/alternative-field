alternative-field
=================

Simple dropdown field which displays a text field when 'Other' is selected. Great for Honorifics selects.

Add the dropdown options to the _config/AlternativeFormField.yml file.

You can also edit the empty string for the dropdown and the label for the 'other' field in the yml.
